This was a game created for Dunkeys Game Jam in 2025. Unfortunately, due to scope and packaging of the build we were not able to make it in time to submit for the jam.
However, we did not give up and decided to at least finish the game, with what each member set out to do.
Created in Unreal Engine 5.5, an action-adventure game where the player climbs up through a dream to kill the nightmare "Custard Dog"!
Created by:
Sebastian Gonzalez (Concept Artist, 3D Modeler, Animator, Writer, Game Designer)
Victor Hernandez (Engineer, Programmer, Game Designer)
Jaiheim Spencer (3D Modeler, Animator, VFX)
Justin Simmons (Level Designer)
Sebastian Michelini (Sound Engineer, SFX)
